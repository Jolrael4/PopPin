# PopPin

Code started as Dukehammer's glowingStatic. I added the glitter function and limited the color during the disco function.

The basic program pops a random number of pins in the same base color. 
*Disco will start with and pop random colors. 
*Glitter will be similar to disco, but will only pop the random color once the pin has faded to black.

# PopPin

The basic program pops a random number of pins in the same base color. 
..*Disco will pop a random number of random colors. 
..*Glitter is similar to disco, but will only pop the random color once the pin has faded to black.

Code started as Dukehammer's glowingStatic. I added the following
..*The glitter function 
..*Limited the random color choice during the disco function.
..*The HTML and CSS files
